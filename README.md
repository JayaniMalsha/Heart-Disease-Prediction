# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Build a model to predict whether a person has heart disease based on medical features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure

##Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on their medical features. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze the dataset and train a model to classify individuals into two categories:

0: No heart disease
1: Heart disease.
The model will be helpful for early detection and intervention, enabling better patient outcomes.

##Languages and Technologies

Dataset
Dataset Source: Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset

##Dataset Description
The dataset contains 14 features that are commonly used in medical diagnosis:

age: Age of the individual (years).
sex: Gender of the individual (1 = male, 0 = female).
cp: Chest pain type (0 = typical angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non-anginal pain, 3 = asymptomatic).
trestbps: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg).
chol: Serum cholesterol level (mg/dl).
fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false).
restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal, 1 = ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = left ventricular hypertrophy).
thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved.
exang: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no).
oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = upsloping, 1 = flat, 2 = downsloping).
ca: Number of major vessels (0â€“3) colored by fluoroscopy.
thal: Thalassemia (1 = normal, 2 = fixed defect, 3 = reversible defect).
target: Target variable (1 = heart disease, 0 = no heart disease).
Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing

Load and explore the dataset.
Handle missing or null values (if any).
Encode categorical variables.
Normalize features using StandardScaler.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyze feature distributions.
Explore correlations between features and the target variable.
Visualize important patterns using charts and plots.
Model Training

Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% train, 20% test).
Train multiple machine learning models:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Evaluate model performance using metrics:
Accuracy
Precision, Recall, F1 Score
Confusion Matrix
Hyperparameter Tuning

Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the Random Forest model.
Model Evaluation

Compare model performance.
Select the best-performing model (Random Forest in this case).
Model Deployment

Save the trained model using joblib.
Test the model on new, unseen data to validate its accuracy.
